Bartacus
========

Bartacus is an iPhone app that provides realtime BART train arrivals and departures.
In addition, Bartacus provides scheduling and routing choices to give Bartacus users a complete BART app
they can rely on for all their BART needs.

I initially started Bartacus as a hands on practical way to learn iOS programming.  I am a frequent BART
rider and it is always more fun to learn an app by doing something that is interesting to you as both a programmer
and a user.

Bartacus may also grow to include other public transportation information, such as local buses or trains
and possibly expand to other cities and counties.

But, for now, Bartacus is focused on just the Bay Area Rapid Transit trains.

If you would like to work on Bartacus together, please drop me a note at:
